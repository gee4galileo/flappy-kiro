# Flappy Kiro

A browser-based Flappy Bird-style game built with vanilla JavaScript and the Canvas API. No build tools, no dependencies at runtime — just open `index.html` in a browser or serve it with any static file server.

## Playing the Game

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8080
# then open http://localhost:8080
```

| Action | Input |
|---|---|
| Flap / advance state | Space, click, or tap |
| Pause / resume | P or Escape (desktop) / tap while paused (mobile) |
| Fire laser | L (desktop only) |

## Architecture

All game logic lives inside a single IIFE in `game.js`. Each class owns one responsibility and communicates through method arguments — no class reads global state except `CONFIG`.

```mermaid
graph TD
    CONFIG["CONFIG (frozen)"]

    subgraph game.js IIFE
        Game["Game\n(coordinator)"]
        Physics["PhysicsEngine"]
        Input["InputHandler"]
        Collision["CollisionDetector"]
        Score["ScoreManager"]
        Audio["AudioManager"]
        Renderer["Renderer"]
        Ghosty["Ghosty"]
    end

    CONFIG -->|constants| Game
    Game -->|owns| Ghosty
    Game -->|update per frame| Physics
    Game -->|flush per frame| Input
    Game -->|check per frame| Collision
    Game -->|checkPipes per frame| Score
    Game -->|SFX / music| Audio
    Game -->|draw per frame| Renderer
```

### Game Loop

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant rAF as requestAnimationFrame
    participant Game
    participant Input as InputHandler
    participant Physics as PhysicsEngine
    participant Collision as CollisionDetector
    participant Score as ScoreManager
    participant Renderer

    rAF->>Game: _loop(timestamp)
    Game->>Game: compute elapsed, dtSec
    Game->>Input: flush() → {flap, pause, laser}
    Game->>Game: handle state transitions
    Game->>Physics: update(ghosty, dtSec, state)
    Game->>Game: spawn pipes / clouds
    Game->>Game: updateObstacles(pipes, clouds, dtSec)
    Game->>Collision: check(ghosty, pipes, clouds, h)
    Game->>Score: checkPipes(pipes, ghosty)
    Game->>Game: updateEffects(particles, popups, shake)
    Game->>Renderer: draw(state, ghosty, pipes, ...)
    Game->>rAF: requestAnimationFrame(loop)
```

## Component Reference

### `ObjectPool`
Generic fixed-capacity pool to avoid GC pressure in the hot path. Used for particles and score popups. `acquire()` returns a recycled object; `release(obj)` returns it to the pool. Falls back to allocating a new object when the pool is exhausted.

### `CONFIG` (`config.js`)
Frozen nested object loaded before `game.js`. All physics, pipe, cloud, effect, and audio constants live here. Never mutate — use multipliers for difficulty scaling.

### `Ghosty`
Character data and animation state. Owns the sprite image, hitbox radius, flap/death timers, and methods for computing visual rotation, bob offset, and death opacity. Reset via `reset(canvasWidth, canvasHeight)`.

### `PhysicsEngine`
Pure update functions. `update(ghosty, dtSec, state)` applies gravity and clamps to terminal velocity. `flap(ghosty, state)` sets upward velocity. Both are no-ops when state is `PAUSED`.

### `InputHandler`
Registers `keydown`, `click`, and `touchstart` listeners once at init. `flush()` returns `{ flap, pause, laser }` and clears all flags — called exactly once per frame.

### `CollisionDetector`
Pure function `check(ghosty, pipes, clouds, canvasHeight)`. Uses a circular hitbox (radius 12px) against pipe rects and cloud AABBs via `circleOverlapsRect`.

```mermaid
graph LR
    ghosty((Ghosty\ncircle r=12))
    topPipe[Top pipe rect]
    bottomPipe[Bottom pipe rect]
    cloud[Cloud AABB]
    boundary[Top/bottom boundary]

    ghosty -- circleOverlapsRect --> topPipe
    ghosty -- circleOverlapsRect --> bottomPipe
    ghosty -- circleOverlapsRect --> cloud
    ghosty -- cy±r --> boundary
```

### `ScoreManager`
Tracks `score` and `highScore`. `checkPipes(pipes, ghosty)` returns the scored pipe (or `null`) — marks `pipe.scored = true` to prevent double-counting. Persists high score to `localStorage` with `try/catch`.

### `AudioManager`
Lazy `AudioContext` created on first user gesture. Background music is a scheduled two-oscillator (square + triangle) pentatonic loop. SFX use `HTMLAudioElement` with `currentTime = 0` reset for instant replay.

### `Renderer`
Stateless draw pipeline. Accepts all data as arguments, never reads game state directly. Background is pre-rendered to an offscreen canvas and `drawImage`'d each frame. Pipe shadow state is set once per frame outside the pipe loop.

#### Draw order (z-order)
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[1. Background] --> B[2. Clouds]
    B --> C[3. Pipes]
    C --> D[4. Ghosty]
    D --> E[5. Particles]
    E --> F[6. Laser beams]
    F --> G[7. Score popups]
    G --> H[8. HUD bar]
    H --> I[9. State overlay]
```

### `Game`
Coordinator. Owns all arrays (`_pipes`, `_clouds`, `_particles`, `_popups`, `_laserBeams`) and timers. All state transitions go through `transitionTo(newState)` — the only place side-effects (audio, reset, shake) are triggered.

---

## Laser

Press `L` during play to fire a horizontal laser beam from Ghosty's right side. The beam carves a hole through any pipe it intersects at Ghosty's current height. 20-second recharge shown bottom-left in the HUD.

```
⚡ LASER [L]   ← ready (cyan)
⚡ 14s         ← recharging (grey)
```

---

## Physics

All values are in px/s or px/s² and scaled by `dtSec` (seconds since last frame):

```
vy += gravity * dtSec          // 800 px/s²
vy  = min(vy, terminalVelocity) // 600 px/s
y  += vy * dtSec
```

Delta-time is capped to `maxDeltaTime` (50ms) to prevent physics tunneling when the tab is backgrounded.

---

## Tests

```bash
npm install          # installs fast-check
npm test             # runs all 84 property-based + unit tests
```

Tests cover 20 correctness properties (P1–P20) across physics, obstacles, collision, scoring, effects, state transitions, input handling, and renderer fallback rendering. All tests run in Node.js with no browser required.

## Configuration

Edit `config.js` to tune game feel (values are sourced from `game-config.json`). Key values:

| Key | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `physics.gravity` | 800 px/s² | Higher = faster fall |
| `physics.jumpVelocity` | -300 px/s | More negative = higher jump |
| `pipes.speed` | 120 px/s | Higher = faster pipes |
| `pipes.gapHeight` | 140 px | Smaller = harder |
| `pipes.spacing` | 750 px | Smaller = pipes closer together |
| `pipes.spawnInterval` | 1800 ms | Lower = more frequent pipes |
| `effects.particleMaxAge` | 500 ms | Longer = longer particle trail |
